# Daily-Diary
This website is thought as a digital personal diary. After signing up for a new account, users can create new text entries each day and choose an emoji that matches their mood for the day. There is also an option to lock these entries. If the user does not want to lock their entries but wants to share and discuss them with their friends, there is an option to post them on the Facebook wall or simply share them via email. Finally, of course, these entries are stored in a calendar where the user can check or delete his old entries.
